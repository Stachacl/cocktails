          cocktails to make at home, from martinis and shorts to larger punches

          Cocktails were introduced lorem ipsum text placeholder below - in the
          drawing rooms of Downton Abbey in the 1920s, when US prohibition
          inspired the insurgence and popularity of American-style bars and
          bartenders in Britain. This well-curated selection of recipes is
          organized by the rooms in the Abbey in which the drinks were served
          and spans everyday sips to party drinks plus hangover helpers and
          more. In addition to classic concoctions like a Mint Julep, Prince of
          Wales Punch, and Ginger Beer, this collection features
          character-specific variations such as Downton Heir, Turkish Attach√©,
          The Valet, and The Chauffeur. The recipes reflect drinks concocted and
          served upstairs and down, as well as libations from village fairs,
          cocktail parties, and restaurant menus typical of the time. Features
          40+ color photographs, including drink images professionaly
          photographed.
